	<h1>Upgrading Facilities to Accommodate the Visually-Impaired</h1>
	
	<p><br>It has already been highlighted that visually-impaired people rely primarily on their senses of touch and hearing to navigate the world around them. Certain aids such as tactile paving are extremely helpful in helping the visually-impaired to navigate successfully and safely. While these are commonly found around public pedestrian footpaths, and within train stations, the severe lack of such navigation aids in private enterprises such as shopping centres and retail outlets is alarming. It thus follows that the visually-impaired have difficulties navigating private enterprises.</p>

<p>A possible solution is the implementation of regulations mandating the installment and maintenance of facilities that ensure the smooth and safe navigation of the visually impaired, such as navigation aids. These facilities should be installed in all public places (such as privately owned shopping malls), even if the said place is not owned by the government. There should also be checks done by officials from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) at these locations, ensuring that the necessary facilities have been installed and are well maintained. This will bring about convenience and independence to the navigation of the visually-impaired, due to the ease of access to some locations. This convenience and independence in their travel will empower them to do more, moving towards an inclusive society.</p>

<p>Additionally, for the benefit of the owners of the places that need to be fitted with visually-impaired-friendly facilities, the government can help to subsidise the cost of installing the facilities, as well as provide incentives such as tax breaks that will further encourage the owners to be willing to install these facilities.</p>

<p>However, one limitation of this solution is that it will be a slow and expensive process, and thus support for it amongst businesses may be lukewarm. Despite this, the upgrading of facilities remains a critical step in the creation of an inclusive society.</p>
