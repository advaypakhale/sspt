        <h1>Singapore's Non-Inclusive Society for the Visually-Impaired</h1>
      	<p>How did the problem come about?</p>
      </div>

  <div class="container" id="significance">
	<h1>Origins of the Issue</h1>
	
	<h4><br><strong>So, why is this the case?</strong></h4>
	
	<p>The crux of the problem is that far too few resources are dedicated to assisting the visually-impaired, and by extension the physically-disabled. Public places may have audio cues and tactile-paving, but private businesses do not. Though the government has attempted to help the visually-impaired with schemes such as the Open Door Fund, set up in 2007 to “[support] costs incurred in job redesign, workplace modification as well as integration and apprenticeship programmes for persons with disabilities” (Society for the Physically Disabled, 2013), the amount allocated is too little- just $1.5 million over the course of six years. </p>
 	
 	<p>
	<br>Our non-inclusive society is a result of two factors: the under representation of the visually-impaired, and the financial cost borne by accommodating the needs of the visually-impaired.
 	</p>
	
	<p>
	<br>Firstly, the issue of underrepresentation. There are no visually-impaired MPs or Ministers in the government. Although Nominated Member of Parliament Ms Chia Yong Yong is, indeed, physically-disabled, suffering from peroneal muscular atrophy, the fact remains that there is no one with firsthand experience being blind in Parliament. As such, the visually-impaired have few advocates in the government. The Singapore government recognizes the need for minority interests to be represented, reserving the presidential election for a member of the Malay minority group, and yet this is not done for the visually-impaired, meaning that decisions made for the physically disabled may not be in the group’s best interest.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<br>Secondly, the financial cost incurred presents a barrier towards a truly inclusive society. Upgrading facilities to make them blind-friendly costs money; so does training and integrating the visually-impaired into workplaces. It is thus not financially viable for small businesses to implement blind-friendly measures due to their cost.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<br>These are two significant problems that may not be solved with talk and awareness alone. They require resources, and more specifically, the commitment of money to the cause of creating more blind-friendly facilities, and job opportunities for the visually impaired. After all, no one is going around persecuting the blind, or specifically designing facilities to be non-inclusive for the visually-impaired. It is simply natural that these problems will arise, as rectifying them is costly. Therefore, it is up to the government to spring into action, and provide sufficient funding and incentives to ensure that it is financially viable for private companies to fix these issues.
	</p>
 	
 	<p>
	<br>Spending resources on a relatively small portion of the population may appear wasteful, but it is an important step to address these issues, and promote welfare for the visually-impaired, and given time, the visually-impaired may too contribute back to society by reintegrating with the workforce.
