	<h1>Improving Job Opportunities for the Visually-Impaired</h1>
	
	<p><br>Solving the problem of the lack of job opportunities for the visually impaired is not going to be easy. It is a problem firmly entrenched in society by both cultural and financial reasons. The visually-impaired are often discriminated against by employers, who believe that they are unable to completely fill in positions in a workplace, necessitating the assistance of other employees to complete their employment duties. Furthermore, integrating blind employees into a workplace may be costly for businesses, unreasonably so for smaller ones, as it requires the workplace be made blind-friendly, and changes be made to how certain duties are performed, and how the company is run in general.</p>

<p><br>The government has attempted to ameliorate the situation through programs such as the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, encouraging continued employment of the disabled, and Open Door Fund, providing job opportunities for the disabled. However, these schemes are not wholly effective, as their scale is limited due to low budgets- the Open Door Fund’s $1.5 million contribution will not make an appreciable impact on the situation at large.</p>

<p><br>Thus, the solution to this issue is clear- the government should allocate more funding to such schemes promoting the employment of the disabled, including that of the visually impaired. Incentives must be made to promote this, such as tax breaks for taking on disabled employees. A leaf could be taken from Germany’s book- a tax which funds schemes promoting the employment of the disabled, to be paid unless 5% of a company’s posts are filled by disabled workers.</p>

<p><br>Furthermore, training programs could be conducted by the MSF for both employers and disabled employees, allowing for easier integration of the disabled into the workforce.</p>

<p><br>In so doing, more job opportunities for the visually-impaired will be available, as employers’ dollars are supplemented by government schemes, and it would be much easier for them to employ the disabled, meaning that any misgivings employers may have would factor less into employment decisions.</p>

<p><br>The limitation of this solution is that it requires considerable commitment of money and effort by the government, something which may be difficult to obtain. However, this truly is the only way to solve the problem of non-inclusivity, and thus no matter how unpleasant the course of action may be, it must be done in order to solve the problem of employment.</p>
