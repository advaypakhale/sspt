	<h1>Significance of The Issue</h1>
	
	<h4><br>Who are the visually impaired?</h4>
	
	<p>The visually impaired are those suffering from medical conditions which reduce their ability to see, that is unable to be corrected by conventional means. This is a group which includes the blind, a group which lacks the ability to see completely, as well as those with extremely poor vision. The cut-off threshold for many first-world countries, like the USA and the UK, is a visual acuity of 2/20 with the best possible correction. Such a person would need to be closer than 2 meters in order to see details that a person with good eyesight could make out at 20 meters. The important clause here is best possible correction- even with glasses or contact lenses, their visual acuity remains below 2/20. As such, these people’s lives are negatively impacted by their poor visual acuity, meaning that many resort to using methods such as seeing-eye dogs and walking sticks in a bid to mitigate the negative effects of disabilities.</p>
	
 	<h4><br>How is the situation in Singapore like?</h4>
 	
 	<p>
 	Singapore is home to about 140,000 people with sensory disabilities, a statistic that includes both the hearing and visually-impaired, of which approximately 70,000 will be visually-impaired. This is approximately 1.5% of Singapore’s 3.9 million-strong resident population! However, in spite of the sizeable number of visually-impaired people in Singapore, visually-impaired people still face a number of challenges in society, such as a lack of blind-friendly facilities islandwide, and poor available employment opportunities.
 	</p>
	
	<p>
	Visually-impaired people rely primarily on their senses of touch and hearing to navigate the world around them. Thus, systems such as tactile-paving are extremely important for accommodating the needs of the visually-impaired. Despite this, though tactile-paving is commonplace around public pedestrian footpaths, and within train stations, many private enterprises, such as shopping centres and retail outlets, do not have blind-accommodating systems in place, meaning that visually-impaired people have difficulties navigating them alone.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In addition, a stigma is attached to the work effectiveness of the visually-impaired, resulting in few job opportunities for the blind- just 275 job vacancies were listed for disabled persons by the Open Door Fund in 2012, a fund dedicated to securing jobs for the disabled. This prevents visually-disabled people from supporting themselves as easily, forcing them to rely on others and perpetuating a cycle of dependency.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As can be seen from the above, Singapore is not a blind-friendly society. This needs to change.
